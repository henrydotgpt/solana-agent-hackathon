# Paygent — Demo Video Script (2 minutes)

## Opening (0:00–0:10)

**[Screen: Landing page hero]**

> "What if accepting payments was as easy as describing your business in a sentence?"

**[Pause. Logo animates in.]**

> "This is Paygent — payments infrastructure for the AI era."

---

## The Problem (0:10–0:25)

**[Screen: Pricing comparison table scrolls up]**

> "Stripe takes 2.9%. PayPal takes 3.49%. For a business doing ten thousand a month, that's over three thousand dollars a year in fees."

**[Paygent row highlights green]**

> "Paygent charges 0.75%. Flat. Non-custodial. Instant settlement on Solana."

## The Demo — Creating a Storefront (0:25–1:10)

**[Screen: Click "Create Storefront" → Chat opens]**

> "Let me show you how it works. I'll type one sentence."

**[Type into chat:]**
`I'm a freelance designer in Dubai. I charge for logo design, brand packages, and rush delivery.`

**[Agent responds, detects business type, asks for products]**

> "The AI understands what I do. Now I list my prices."

**[Type:]**
```
Logo Design - 2 SOL
Brand Package - 5 SOL
Rush Delivery - 50 USDC
```

**[Agent confirms, asks for wallet]**

> "It parsed everything. Now I paste my wallet address."

**[Paste wallet address → Agent confirms → "Building your storefront..." animation plays]**

> "That's it. Three messages. Under 60 seconds."

**[Storefront preview appears with products and live URL]**

> "My storefront is live. Real Solana Pay QR codes. Real payment links."

---

## The Storefront (1:10–1:35)

**[Click "View Live Storefront" → /pay/slug page loads]**

> "This is what my clients see. Clean. Professional. They pick a service, scan the QR code, and pay."

**[Click "Pay Now" on Logo Design → Payment modal opens with QR code]**

> "The QR code is a real Solana Pay transaction request. It splits the payment — 99.25% goes to my wallet, 0.75% platform fee. All in one transaction."

**[Show the fee breakdown in the modal]**

> "Completely transparent. The customer pays 2 SOL. I receive 1.985 SOL. Paygent takes 0.015. Done."

---

## The Dashboard (1:35–1:55)

**[Click Dashboard → /dashboard/slug loads]**

> "Every payment shows up in real-time. Revenue, pending payments, platform fees — all tracked."

**[Point to stats cards]**

> "Helius webhooks push transaction data the moment it confirms on-chain. No polling. No delays."

**[Show notification bell]**

> "And I get notified instantly when someone pays."

---

## Closing (1:55–2:00)

**[Screen: CTA section — "Your storefront is one sentence away."]**

> "Paygent. The first payment processor built entirely by AI agents. Zero human code. 0.75% fees. Live in 60 seconds."

**[Logo + tagline: "Payments that build themselves."]**

> "Try it now."

## Recording Notes

- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 at 60fps
- **Browser:** Chrome, dark mode, clean profile (no extensions visible)
- **Speed:** Real-time creation, no fast-forwarding the chat (it's already fast)
- **Music:** Lo-fi ambient, subtle, nothing distracting
- **Voice:** Clear, confident, conversational — not salesy
- **Key moments to nail:**
  1. The typing in chat → instant understanding (AI feels smart)
  2. The storefront going live (the "wow" moment)
  3. The QR code with fee breakdown (transparency = trust)
  4. The dashboard updating (professional, real product feel)
